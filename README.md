Today's problem 
Level Simple (maybe medium)
String Decoder this problem was ask in kanaka software cosultanty pvt. ltd. company's placement test
Don't have the ful descreption of the problem but I mentioned what I remembered about the problem

Sample Input:
int N = 5
String S = "abcde"

Output: 
dcbaz
Approach
1) Reverse the Input String
2) Shift each letter back by 1 of String
 [ abcde -> edcba -> dcbaz ]
